    "# Predicting Mushroom Edibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: Do not use any of the data or machine learning techniques found in this notebook to decide whether or not to pick a mushroom in the wild. The dataset used only includes information on 32 different species of mushroom and is not indicative of all fungi and their toxicological properties. Predictions made by the machine learning models in this notebook are also not necessarily indicative of whether a mushroom is poisonous or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have never gone foraging for mushrooms and quite frankly, I don't plan to in my lifetime.  There's a very good reason why: if you pick the wrong mushroom and eat it, you could DIE! That's a terrifying prospect. If only there were a way to know if you picked an edible mushroom... \n",

    "The intent for this project is to determine the optimal machine learning model for predicting the edibility of mushrooms. The data used for this project was provided by UCI Machine Learning on Kaggle. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).

This inevitably excludes it from being the model of choice.\n",
